# Customer-Segmentation-using-market-basket-analysis
This repository includes a Python Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and customer segmentation using unsupervised machine learning techniques like K-Means clustering and RFM metrics (Recency, Frequency, Monetary). Using the Online Retail dataset, the analysis uncovers patterns and insights through visualizations, enabling data-driven decisions for e-commerce businesses


## **Features**  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzed data distribution, missing values, and trends to understand the dataset.  
- **Unsupervised Learning**:  
  - Applied **K-Means Clustering** for customer segmentation.  
  - Utilized **RFM Metrics** (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) to categorize customers into actionable segments.  
- **Data Visualization**: Generated visualizations (e.g., scatter plots, bar graphs, and heatmaps) for better insight into patterns and trends.  
- **Insights and Recommendations**: Extracted data-driven insights and proposed recommendations based on customer behavior.

## **Dataset**  
The [Online Retail dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+Retail#) contains transactions from a UK-based online retailer between **01-12-2010** and **09-12-2011**. The dataset includes attributes such as InvoiceNo, StockCode, Description, Quantity, InvoiceDate, UnitPrice, CustomerID, and Country.

## **Technologies Used**  
- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn, mlxtend  

## **Installation**
